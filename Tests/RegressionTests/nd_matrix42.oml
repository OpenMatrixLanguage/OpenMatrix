% The rule is to match the RHS dimensions to the LHS dimensions if there is
% a clear 1:1 correspondence. In cases that have a mismatch or excess colons,
% use a squeeze strategy to map dimensions from the RHS to the LHS by skipping
% over singleton dimensions.
% The case above will use the squeeze strategy, but the case below will not,
% and will therefore produce a different result.
